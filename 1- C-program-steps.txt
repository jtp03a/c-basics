/****************
Editing - process of creating and modifying your C source code
  .c extension
Compiling - Compiler converts your source code into machine language and detects and reports errors
  Two Stage Process:
    PreProcessing Phase
    Compilation
  checks syntax, semantics
  structural errors
  does not find logic issues
  After errors are fixed compiler takes each statement of the program and translates to assembly language
  compiler then translates the assembly language statements into actual machine instructions
  output from the compiler is known as object code and stored in files called object files (.obj, .o)
Linking - After translating into object code, getting all the dependencies in place and building the executable file
  grouping all the obj files 
  combines object modules generated by compiler with additional libraries needed to create the whole executable
  detects and reports other kinds of errors - linking errors
Executing - Run the program
  execute each statement sequentially
